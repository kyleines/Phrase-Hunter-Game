# Phrase Hunter Game

### Welcome to my Phrase Hunter Game for the Team Treehouse: FSJS Techdegree - Unit 4 Project.

This project is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) at [kyleines.github.io/Phrase-Hunter-Game](https://kyleines.github.io/Phrase-Hunter-Game/).

By selecting one letter at a time, figure out the hidden phrase to win the game!

This game's features include: \
:heavy_check_mark: Ten phrases cycled through randomly. \
